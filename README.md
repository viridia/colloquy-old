# About Colloquy

Colloquy is a server for discussion forums. It aims to provide a pleasant,
easy-to-use experience for both desktop and mobile users. It's also designed
to work in conjunction with other servers that manage group membership.

Discussion groups in Colloquy are called "channels". The set of available

API.
